### Flask Application Design for GenAI Based Learning Assistant

**HTML Files**

1. **index.html**: This is the homepage of the application. It should contain a simple UI to converse with the app. This could be a text box for the user to enter their question and a button to submit it.
2. **results.html**: This page will display the results of the user's query. It should include the retrieved information from the document indexing and information retrieval.

**Routes**

1. **home**: This route will serve the index.html file.
2. **result**: This route will handle the user's query and return the results by rendering the results.html file.

**Code**

The following code snippets show how to implement the routes using Flask:

```python
# Import necessary modules from Flask
from flask import Flask, render_template, request

# Create a Flask application
app = Flask(__name__)

# Define route for the homepage
@app.route('/')
def home():
    return render_template('index.html')

# Define route for handling user queries
@app.route('/results', methods=['POST'])
def result():
    # Retrieve the user's query from the form
    query = request.form['query']

    # Generate the response using the GenAI model
    response = generate_response(query)

    # Render the results page with the generated response
    return render_template('results.html', response=response)

# Run the Flask application
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

**Retrieval Augmented Generation Code**

The Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) code will be responsible for indexing the documents and generating responses to the user's queries. Here's an example of how this code could be structured:

```python
# Import necessary modules
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM

# Load the tokenizer and model
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("facebook/rag-token-base")
model = AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM.from_pretrained("facebook/rag-sequence-base")

# Function to index the documents
def index_documents(documents):
    # TODO: Implement logic for indexing the documents

# Function to generate a response to a query using the indexed documents
def generate_response_with_RAG(query):
    # TODO: Implement logic for generating a response using RAG
```

This code provides a basic outline for indexing documents and generating responses using RAG, but it needs to be customized and implemented according to the specific requirements of the learning assistant and the available dataset.

**Implementation Notes**

- Use a database to store the indexed documents for efficient retrieval.
- Explore additional Flask features, such as error handling and session management, to enhance the user experience.
- Customize the UI and styling of the application to suit the requirements of the learning assistant.

**Testing**

Thoroughly test the application to ensure it handles user queries correctly and provides accurate and relevant responses.

**Deployment**

Once the application is fully tested and verified, deploy it to a suitable web server.
